# Who
I'm Gavin. I've been a professional web developer for over a decande.

# What
I started with MS JScript so I've been exposed to all sorts of JS environments and frameworks (for better or worse). 

These days my professional roles are mostly back-end PHP. Generally internal tools and exposing/consuming APIs though I have experience through the stack (particularly AWS infrastructure) and DBA.

Though I'm no stranger to 'vanilla' OOP and functional PHP I mostly use Laravel as a framework at my last few roles. 

# Why
I'm interested in more moden Javascript framework roles these days so I'm trying to build up experience in them. Rect Native, Vue, Svelte (Svelte is lovely please try it) etc.

# Where
I'm based in South West London but have had fully remote roles since 2016 so the post-pandemic job landscape was an easy transition for me thankfully.

# Who
I'm Gavin. I've been a professional web developer for over a decade.

# What
Mostly back end API integrations / development and in-house tooling.

Usually in PHP (5.3ðŸ¤¢, 7+ðŸ™‚, 8+ðŸ˜ƒ, Vanilla & Laravel) but a good working knowledge of Javascript (React, React-Native, Svelte, Node, Electron, Browser based ECMA6 & older) and some hands on with Python.

Good experience of SQL & Postgres, some experience of nosql and redis. Both ORM and raw queries extensively.

Some experience of server management through AWS and Redhat / Debian machine configuration and admin.

# Why
I'm interested in more moden Javascript framework roles these days so I'm trying to build up experience in them. React, React-Native, Vue, Svelte etc.

# Where
I'm based in South West London but have had fully remote roles since 2016 and as such have no problems working from home.

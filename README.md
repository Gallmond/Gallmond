# Who
I'm Gavin. I've been a professional web developer for over a decade.

# What
Mostly back end API integrations / development and in-house tooling.

- PHP (vanilla & Laravel)
- Node.JS (JS & TS)
- Client-side JS & TS (vanilla, Svelte, React)
- React Native
- Working knowledge of Python

Good experience of SQL & Postgres, some experience of nosql and redis. Both ORM and raw queries extensively.

Good experience of infrastructure configuration and management through AWS and directly on Redhat / Debian machines. Including some GCS and Firebase.

# Why
Always starting random projects to play with a new framework or test a small idea. Interested in doing more group projects and working with clientside frameworks. Love Svelte.

# Where
I'm based in South West London but have had fully remote roles since 2016 and as such I'm well suited to remote and asynchronous roles.
